# StockPulseAI
A deep learning-based stock prediction model that analyzes financial indicators to recommend whether to buy a stock. Trained on historical financial data from multiple years, this project aims to provide an intelligent decision-making tool for traders and investors.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Title
StockPulseAI üìà
2Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction
StockPulseAI is a machine learning model that predicts whether to buy a stock based on its financial performance. Using historical financial data, we apply deep learning techniques to classify stocks as buy or not buy, helping investors make informed decisions.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset
We used a Kaggle dataset containing financial data from 2014 to 2018. Each dataset includes 200+ financial indicators commonly found in 10-K filings of publicly traded US companies.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Technologies Used
Python üêç
TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning)
Pandas & NumPy (data manipulation)
Scikit-learn (data preprocessing)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualization)
5Ô∏è‚É£ Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
